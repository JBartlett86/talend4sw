Talend for Semantic Web (talend4sw)

The goal of this project is to create Talend components, an open source ETL software (http://talend.com),
to help to produce, consume and publish RDF Linked Data on the Semantic Web.

These components are created within de Bio2RDF project but are designed so they can be used 
in any semantic web ETL project.
